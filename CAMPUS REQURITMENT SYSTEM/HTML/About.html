       <p> Job analysis for new jobs or substantially changed jobs. It might be undertaken to document the knowledge, skills, abilities and other
         characteristics (KSAOs) required or sought for the job. From these, the relevant information is captured in a person specification.
        Sourcing — attracting or identifying candidates
        Screening and selection - picking, interviewing and hiring the right candidate.</p>
    <h2 id="source">Sourcing</h2>
        <p>Sourcing is the use of one or more strategies to attract or identify candidates to fill job vacancies. It may involve internal and/or external recruitment advertising, 
        using appropriate media such as job portals, local or national newspapers, social media, business media, specialist recruitment media, professional publications, 
        window advertisements, job centers, or in a variety of ways via the internet.
         Alternatively, employers may use recruitment consultancies or agencies to find otherwise scarce candidates—who, in many cases, may be content in their 
        current positions and are not actively looking to move. This initial research for candidates—also called name generation—produces contact information for potential candidates, whom the recruiter can then discreetly contact and screen.</p>
        <h2 id="program">Referral recruitment programs</h2>
        <br>
        Referral recruitment programs allow both outsiders and employees to refer candidates for filling job openings. Online, they can be implemented by leveraging social networks.
    <h2 id="cost"Employee referral></h2>
    <p>An employee referral is a candidate recommended by an existing employee. This is sometimes referred to as referral recruitment. Encouraging existing employees to select and recruit suitable 
        candidates results in:
        Improved candidate quality ('fit'). Employee referrals allow existing employees to screen, select and refer candidates, lowers staff attrition rate; candidates hired through 
        referrals tend to stay up to 3 times longer than candidates hired through job boards and other sources. The one-to-one direct relationship between 
        the candidate and the referring employee and the exchange of knowledge that takes place allows the candidate to develop a strong understanding of the company, its business and 
        the application and recruitment process.
        The employee typically receives a referral bonus, and is widely acknowledged as being cost-effective. The Global Employee Referral Index 2013 Survey found that 92% of participants reported employee referrals as one of the top recruiting sources.
        As candidate quality improves and interview-to-job-offer conversion rates increase, the amount of time spent interviewing decreases, which means the company's employee headcount can be streamlined and be used more efficiently. Marketing and advertising expenditures
        decrease as existing employees source potential candidates from existing personal networks of friends, family, and associates. By contrast, recruiting through third-party recruitment agencies incurs a 20–25% agency finder's fee
        which can top $25K for an employee with $100K annual salary.
        There is, however, a risk of less corporate creativity: An overly homogeneous workforce is at risk for "fails to produce novel ideas or innovations</p>
   <aside>
        Internal recruitment or internal mobility(not to be confused with internal recruiters) refers to the process of a candidate being selected from the existing workforce 
        to take up a new job in the same organization, perhaps as a promotion, or to provide career development opportunity, or to meet a specific or urgent organizational need. 
        Advantages include the organization's familiarity with the employee and their competencies insofar as they are revealed in their current job, and their willingness to trust said employee. 
        It can be quicker and get job.
